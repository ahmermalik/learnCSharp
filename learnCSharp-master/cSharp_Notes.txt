c# & .NET notes:


.NET Framework (Windows Only)

.NET Core (Linux, Mac, Windows, ARM)


.NET is a CLR (Common Language Runtime)
It provides you space to run your program, manage memory for it, and send the cpu information to run processes



** Classes **

In C# class defines a new type, a type allows you to do things.

-examples of types: string, doubles.

1) How do you know when to create a new class?
you have to look and see when a method is too complex (too much functionality.)
this is when you should find a way to **encapsulate** the code into new classes to
be in specific to their functionality.


 -Every class and every type you write should be within a name space. If it's not,
it is in a global namespace and that is dangerous. someone else can put their own class in the global namespace and it can
cause conflicts in the program, for instance within the built-in dotnet libraries.

                    Examples of namespace being imported:
                    using System;
                    using System.Collections.Generic

When you're using Console.WriteLine() it is using the System namespace.


Namespace convention:
-it should be limited to one namespace per file.

Class convention:
-think of class as a blue print. it defines how you'll build objects.
-it should be limited to one class per file.
-what should be the behavior of this class? What can it do? What state will it hold(data structure)?
    ex: it can add, remove, and sort stuff.
